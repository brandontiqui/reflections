When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
Remote repositories are used when work will be published on GitHub.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Some commits may not be ready for publishing.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Fork copies another GitHub user's repo (that you don't have permission to add to) to your repo on GitHub's servers.  Cloning a repo from GitHub place the repo onto your local machine; forking is also a form of cloning on GitHub's servers.  Branches are labels for a series of commits; the label will always reference the tip of the branch.
