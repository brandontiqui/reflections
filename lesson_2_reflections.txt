What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
A .git  file is added.  Nothing is committed.  Files are untracked.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
A working directory contains files and is not a repository.  Using git init turns a working directory into a git repository.  git add places files into the staging area until they are commmitted.  Files can be reviewed in the staging area by other members of a team.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
Do a git diff and git diff --staged to ensure that there is only one logical change.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?
Having a different mode in a game or experimental features.
